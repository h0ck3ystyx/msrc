This is the local level we include so all these product end up
in the right place if you unpack the file at /usr/msrc.  Almost all
the other packages are built from /usr/msrc/local so you will clobber
this file with the README file from each subsequent package as you
unpack them.

You can extract packages under /usr/msrc/Pkgs/name and that works as well
(that way you don't clobber the READMEs).
