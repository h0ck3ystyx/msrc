Prep.

 Read distrib.man.

 Make a list of the machines on your network, and which ones are (should be)
 running the same software (binary files).  Choose a name for each group of
 such hosts and pick one to be the one you build/compile on.  You now have
 a list of <machine, group> and a note on some of them that they have source.

 Don't worry too much if your list doesn't have *every* local UNIX host in
 it, start small, you can add new machines later if you like.

 Using the first component on the offcial host name as a short hostname,
 turn the list into a table that looks like distrib.cf.

 You might never use the 4th col, as far as I know no one does (anymore);
 but the rule is to turn dots (points) in the official OS release into
 zeros leaving 2 places for each factor.  So SunOS 4.1.4 becomes 40104
 and KSBIX 2.30 becomes 230.]

 # official		Short 	 CPU	OS		has
 # Hostname		Hostname Type	revision	source
 #
 j.cc.purdue.edu	j	 VAX780	404		yes
 l.cc.purdue.edu	l	 VAX780	404		.
 svr5.dspd.fedex.com	srv5	 HPUX9	905		yes
 ....

 Now you have your own distrib.cf, the prototype is (mostly) saved in the
 Examples directory so name yours distrib.cf.


Compile:

 Now days mkcmd fills in the full path to rdist and m4.  You'll have to
 have mkcmd-7.21 or better installed.  I use mkcmd-8.13.

 Try a make:
	make

 If that worked out try:
	./distrib.x -C my-distrib.cf -V
 you should see (s/_/$/, ignore HPUX9):
	distrib.x: _Id: distrib.m,v 4.22 1999/06/20 10:38:58 ksb Dist _
	distrib.x: using configuration from `my-distrib.cf'
	distrib.x: default column headers: %HOST SHORTHOST HOSTTYPE HOSTOS HASSRC
	distrib.x: compiled HOSTTYPE matches configured HPUX9
	distrib.x: library path "/usr/local/lib/distrib"
	distrib.x: rdist binary is "/usr/local/bin/rdist"
	distrib.x: m4 binary is "/usr/bin/m4"

 Now try
	$ Scripts/minfo.sh `hostname`
 you should get something like:
	Machine:  svr6      (svr6)
	Type:     HPUX9/905  (same)

 Try the Examples.

 You should use "make install" to instal the tool:
	make install

Docs:

 If you have mkcat(1L) you know what to do.  Others can install the man
 pages how ever local custom dictates.

 The meta source documents (HTML style) are avaliable from me in another
 source lump.  Read them before you go too much further.
