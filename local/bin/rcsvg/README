`RCS version get' grabs a named (rcs -NName: or ci -NName) revision of
each file in a product copying it out to a stage area.  The stage area is
constructed to match the product heirarchy exactly.  Symbolc links and
any directory with an RCS subdirectory are framed in as well.

Input:
	a symbolic or numeric revision number (rev)
	an output stage area [/tmp/$rev]
	a product source tree [.]

Options:
	the std be-verbose, not-really flags (-v, -n)
	a previous revision to compare against (-r PreRev)

Output:
	stdout is some blather about what we found
	stderr is a report of the files we couldn't find the named
	   revision for (but we found the previous?)

Todo:
	add a state to check for all revisions (-s Clean)
	check for other features we need in common practice
	describe how this is used in the meta source system

Example:
	rcsvg -S /tmp/ksb Feb64
		pull the RCS symbolic revision "Feb64" from all the cached
		file in "." and copy them to /tmp/ksb.

	rcsvg 1.1 src
		pull the initial revisions (1.1) of all the cached files in 
		"src" into /tmp/1.1.

See the meta source papers for details.
