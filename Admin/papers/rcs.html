<H1>What revision control does for you</H1>
<P>
Revision control allows you to check-point a file as you refine
its contents.
Names (or numbers) on each <A href="revision">revision</A> of the
file, created as you make changes, allow you to track differences,
backout of changes that didn't work out, or work on future refinements
while the other engineers are poking along with their changes.

<P>
By using the file name <STONG>and</STONG> the revision name to
specify the component we are using we eliminate the need to keep
parallel file system heirarchies for each step forward.  This
reduces the disk space, number of files, and management costs to
the project team.

<H2>What does this mean to me?</H2>
<P>
Cutting to the core here, revisions with strict locking:
<UL>
<LI>mark stable points in the developement cycle for each file
<LI>make it easy to track who made what changes
<LI>keep modifications linear
<LI>make a nice log for management
</UL>
