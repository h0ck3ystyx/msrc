This outline describes the steps to add a new platform to the meta
source system.  See "msrc-0" for details about the construction of
the first meta source host (the "master" source machine). -- ksb

It really helps a lot if you have gcc, flex, bison and rdist already
build and installed before you start this.  Most FreeBSD/LINUX or
Sun systems do because so many Open Source products need them.

On the master source machine:
	install a *.cf file for distrib for the new machine
		(or add the line to one)

Make the target machine root equiv from the master source host.
	Either in root's .ssh/authorized_keys or root's .rhosts.

	Make root's shell sh compatible (sh, ksh, bash) if you can.

	If you must build rdistd by hand (rdist-6.1.4 or better).
	See: http://www.MagniComp.com/rdist/
	Test this with an rdist of /etc/motd to /tmp/motd (or similar).

On the target machine (via a local shell or rdist):
	install a local.defs file in /usr/local/lib/distrib/local.defs
		PATH must contain sh, cc [gcc?], make, and install
		SHELL mush be /bin/sh compatible [ksh is OK]
		umask 022 or as apropos

	Add the "source" group you need
		source:*:810:
	Optionally add the group "charon" for file entombing
		charon:*:602:
	Optionally add the login "charon" for file entombing
		charon:*:11520:602:The Ferryman,Admin,588-2300,:/home/amdin/Tomb:/nonexistant

	build /usr/src/local/{bin,lib,etc}
	build /usr/local/{bin,lib,etc,man,lib/distrib}
		umask 002
		mkdir -p /usr/src/local/bin /usr/src/local/lib
		mkdir -p /usr/src/local/etc
		umask 022
		mkdir -p /usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib /usr/local/etc
		mkdir -p /usr/local/man /usr/local/lib/distrib
	fix the modes on those:
		chgrp source /usr/src/local /usr/src/local/*
		chmod g+s /usr/src/local /usr/src/local/*/

On the master source machine:
	make for the host in all in:
		mkcmd's lib/mkcmd
		install's lib/install.cf
		mkcmd's bin/mkcmd
		install's bin/install.d

	make install for:
		install's bin/install.d
		mkcmd's bin/mkcmd
		mkcmd's lib/mkcmd
		distrib's etc/distrib

	make optional tools:
		gcc		[if no vendor one is installed cross compile it]
		flex		[if no vendor lex]
		bison		[if no vendor yacc]
		gzip	
		rcs		[if no vendor rcs co/ci/rlog/...]
		man		[if no vendor man (from msrc/ucb/man)]
		purge
		instck
		tpsh
		distrib (+ lib)
		rcsvg
		xapply
		mk (+ lib)
		less
		untmp
		conserver
		console
		x3270

build bogus libs:
		libptm
		libsrtunq
		datecut

back to bin:
		maketd
		labstat

optional etc
		labd
		labc
		labwatch
