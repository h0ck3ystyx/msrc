<P>
Some C programs and shell scripts make it a lot easier to
run a master source (or meta source) pool.
While none of these are (strictly) mandatory they are enabling
technologies for certain.
<P>
Even the <I>rdist></I> front end, distrib, could be replaced by
some in-line shell code (which I will <A href="#joke">not include here</A>).

Actually you loose the @file@ extension which pretty much

the current stock look like a walk in the park.

Don't even think about it.
