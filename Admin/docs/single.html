<H1>Starting at the single platform</H1>
<P>
If we limit our view (for the time being) to a single target platform we 
can build an understanding for what must lay
before us. (Yes, I mean that both ways.)

<H2>From the `Net</H2>
<P>
The standard Internet package one might pluck from an FTP
archive has:
<UL>
<LI>a "Configure" script [maybe]
<LI>an "INSTALL" or "README" set of instructions
<LI>a make(1) "Makefile" to construct the product
<LI>a set of C source files (implementation and header files)
<LI>some yacc/lex or some other helper input [maybe]
<LI>some documentation [hopefully]
</UL>

<P>
Of these the "INSTALL" and "README" files are useless to any automation.
The "Configure" script falls back to an interactive mode if it has
any choices to make (which makes it hard to automate without "expect").

<A name="makefile">
<P>Starting with the "Makefile" (sometimes spelled "makefile") we
have some structure that supports automation.
We are going to assume some <EM>cultural</EM> structure is in place
(or can be added with minimal cost) to each make(1) description:</A>

<UL>
<LI>Install all the 
<A href="make.html">standard targets</A>.

<LI>Split CFLAGS (or related macros for other compilers into the three
orthogonal components (CDEFS, DEBUG, INCLUDE).
This allows us to tune compilation from the command line (or other
processors) for debugging or compiler type without knowing the include
path.

<LI>Include a -D<I>type</I> in CDEFS where <I>type</I> is a
short descriptive name for the current platform.

<LI>Check the final load line for any special libraries needed.
In addition
some loaders need a funny option (-z, -h) or search path option (-L).
</UL>

<P>
This should yield a make(1) description that gives us the invariants
that we need:
<OL>
<LI>builds the product without human intervention
<LI>fits the existing make(1) culture (macro and target names)
<LI>allows the leverage we need to refine it later
<LI>supports the culture we are building
</OL>

<P>After this customization to the Makefile we should not need any
"Configure" script to build the product on this (single) platform.
We may have found a feature the product needs that the
platform doesn't provide (like strstr(3)).

<H1>Emulations and Property Attributes</H1>

<P>It might be appropriate to include emulation code in a canonical
file to be carried with this source.

<A name="machine_h">
<H3>Header files used to map <I>types</I> to <I>properties</I></H3>
</A>
<P>Some emulations are so small that they can even be done in a C
header file.
We use a "machine.h" file to map emulations needed and facilities supported,
on a platform basis, to
<EM>property</EM> based attributes.

<P>
This file maps the <I>type</I> that the Makefile passes in as a cpp(1)
macro to many property macros thusly:
<PRE><CODE>
	#if !defined(HAVE_<I>property</I>)
	#define HAVE_<I>property</I>	(defined(<I>type</I>)||defined(<I>type</I>))
	#endif
</CODE></PRE>

<A name="kinds">
<P>There are a few distinct kinds of properties.
</A>
<UL>
<LI>HAVE_<I>property</I> -- this platform has a facility that others might not.
<LI>USE_<I>property</I> -- this platform might have many ways to get this
service, we pick this property over any other.
<LI>NEED_<I>property</I> -- we are requesting "machine.h" to build an
emulation for this facility.
<LI>BIN_<I>program</I> -- this is the full path to a program
<LI>PATH_<I>file</I> -- this is the full path to a configuration file
<LI>HAS_<I>property</I> -- just like HAVE_<I>property</I>, but older
<LI>BROKEN_<I>property</I> -- do not use this facility here
<LI>PATCH_LEVEL -- a special one we reserve for patch(1) use
<LI>DEF_<I>property</I> -- a default value which might tune per platform
</UL>

<A name="machine_c">
<H3>C coded emulations</H2>

<P>
Additional emulations are larger (but still small) so we have to make a
C source file to keep those.
We use a "machine.c" file to
emulate facilities that the platform is missing.
This file has emulations which are triggered by code which
looks like:</A>
<PRE><CODE>
	#if NEED_<I>property</I>
	/* emulation code for the hollow tree routine
	 */
	is_hollow(....)
	{
	}
	#endif /* <I>property</I> emulation */
</CODE></PRE>

<A name="file_c">
<H3>Production C code (declarations)</H3>
</A>
<P>
By including the "machine.h" file in each C source file plus some
standard system includes we provide just enough leverage to
decide which facility to choose to gain the functions we need to
implement the product at hand.
<P>
After we know which facility we are using we may need to declare, define
or include parts.
This looks like:
<PRE><CODE>
	#if NEED_<I>property</I>
	#include <shallow.h>

	SHALLOW *pSHRoot;
	#endif
</CODE></PRE>

<P>
Since "machine.h" mapped the HOSTTYPE to a property macro we
should always use the property here.

<A name="Cusage">
<H3>Production C code (usage)</H3>
</A>
At the actual use of the facility we may need some more leverage
(preferably we map 2 facilities into a common calling convention, but
sometimes we can't).
When we can't fold them they look like this:
<PRE><CODE>
	#if HAVE_FCHOWN
		if (-1 == fchown(fdThis, 0, -1)) {
			...
		}
	#else
		if (-1 == chown(pcThis, 0, -1)) {
			...
		}
	#endif
</CODE></PRE>

<A name="libs">
<H3>Special Libraries</H3>
</A>
Any libraries which are needed on just this platform (like -lgen)
or special library search paths (-L/usr/local/lib) need to be put
directly on the load line (not in a macro by CFLAGS).

<A name="mkcat">
<H3>Documentation, manual pages</H3>
</A>
The program <EM>mkcat</EM> has been constructed to install manual pages.
It is presently under revision but should be complete by fall 2000.

<A name="rcs">
<H3>Source code kept under RCS</H3>
</A>
No files will be kept on a platform source machine under RCS, unless
extreme unction has been granted by the Tech Advisor.
In that strange case the RCS cache directory will most likely
<STRONG>not</STRONG> reside under /usr/src.

<A name="install">
<H3>Install the product</H3>
</A>
A safer version of install is available.  Use it.

<A name="distrib">
<H3>Distribution to like machine</H3>
</A>
This is the other job for distrib.
Distrib's -c option may be used to transmit files to like peer platforms.
Thus we compile on one representative machine for each platform type
and distribute the code to all her friends.


<H2>The results for a single platform</H2>
With this paradigm we have build a clear path to port to other platforms.
By mapping the property macros for a new HOSTTYPE we should only have to
update "machine.h" and change the libraries and -D<I>type</I> in the Makefile.
<P>
The remainder of this document builds on that abstraction to automate it.
