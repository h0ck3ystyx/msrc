<H2>The product that warps time -- rcsvg</H2>
</A>
<P>
After testing we have a "perfect" release of a product. (At least that's
what we tell the managers.)
If we mark the RCS revisions that compose each version of each
product that makes up the software subsystem that we are releasing
we can get back to that version with the RCS command "co" (check out).
<P>
Of course if we have many directories in a heirarchy it might be
hard to recreate the whole without making a typeo.  We could build
a makefile to do the work with <CODE>mkdir</CODE>, <CODE>co</CODE>,
<CODE>chmod</CODE> and the like.
<P>
This would get unmanagable if the symbolic names for the various parts
of the system were not well structured, or if the source caches were
scattered about the filesystem.
<P>
<CODE>Rcsvg</CODE> is an interface to RCS to do all this work of
recovering a marked state in the RCS cache files in a single command.


<A name="makefile">
<H2>Additions to a master source Makefile</H2>
</A>
<P>
The new target "stage"  in
the meta source makefiles (Package level) add the ability to form
packages of related products that can be built as a unit.

<P>
A "clean" operation undoes the stage operation.

<A name="tracking">
<H2>Problem tracking</A>
</A>
<P>
At the package level we can track outstanding bugs or design limits
in a TODO list.  These lists cross product boundries to include
changes in more than one product.
