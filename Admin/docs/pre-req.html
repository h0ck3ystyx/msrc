<H1>UNIX Implementations</H1>

<P>UNIX provides most of the utility base for the source
organization.
These tools implement the framework of the source organization:
<UL>
<H3><LI>RCS -- ci, co, rcs, rcsdiff</H3>
<A name="revision">
A revision control system.</A>
This tracks changes and
allows the implementor recover from misdirected efforts.
This document assumes the use of RCS, the SCCS product may
be substituted with little effort.

<H3><LI>make</H3>
<A name="make">
A utility for constructing a product from its parts.<A/>
Since a version is constructed from revisions we need a tool to
control that process.

<H3><LI>sh</H3>
<A name="shell">
The programming language for issuing system commands.
</A>

<H3><LI>rdist</H3>
<A name="rdist">
The control for transmitting files peer to peer or master to slave.
</A>
We will actually build a small front end program on top of rdist
to save effort in integration (called <EM>distrib</EM>).

<H3><LI>m4</H3>
<A name="macro">
A macro processor to filter text based on a "type" key.
</A>
``The use of m4 shows questionable judgment.''
</UL>

<A name="local">
<H1>Access to utilities</H1>
</A>
To gain access to the system C compiler, linker, and other
UNIX utilities we must
set some system parameters (viz. umask and $PATH).
<P>
We could encode the system C compile in the Makefile as:
<PRE><CODE>
	CC=gcc
</CODE></PRE>
but that doesn't set the search path ($PATH).
<P>
If we encode the search path in the name:
<PRE><CODE>
	CC=/opt/gnu/bin/gcc
</CODE></PRE>
We face changing all the Makefiles on the system if the
C compiler changes.
Using the UNIX search path is the clever choice here,
the only implementation detail is how to leverage that
facility.
<P>
We will integrate support for this requirement in a file
called "local.defs" which is usually located in
/usr/local/lib/distrib/local.defs.
This file just sets a search path that includes the C compiler
and other tools needed to build most applications on this
platform.
On FREEBSD, for example, it looks like:
<PRE><CODE>
	PATH=/usr/local/etc:/usr/local/bin:$PATH:/usr/sbin
	export PATH
	umask 022
</CODE></PRE>
<P>
On Sun Solaris systems we must include "/usr/ccs/bin" in the PATH.
Other systems may have other games we have to play (EP/IX is bad).

<H1>Issues with access to other products</H1>
<P>
In addition to the frame-work tools described above most
useful products need access to a compiler or interpreter.
To be successful we need to pick
which compiler to use and what options to put on the
command line.
By "which" we mean the name as well as the location.
