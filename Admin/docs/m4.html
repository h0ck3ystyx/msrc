<H1>How to use m4 and still stay mostly sane</H1>
The UNIX macro processor m4 has a really bad reputation.
<EM>They</EM> say that m4 is cryptic and that you will grow
hair on your palms for using it.
They are wrong.

<H2>M4 needs protection</H2>
The first key to using m4 for success is that m4 requires you
to quote text that should <EM>not</EM> be expanded.
Words like "include",  "Unix", and "define" are m4 keywords
and will be consumed by m4 without comment if used inappropriately.
<P>
To prevent this we must begin a m4'd file with an open quote (<CODE>`</CODE>)
like this:<PRE>
<CODE>	`# Makefile for the grumf product
	# this program begins the cranking with a bandage...
	#
	...
</CODE></PRE>

And end the file with a m4 trick to suppress the extra newline:<PRE>
<CODE>	...
	foo.o: foo.c barg.h grumf.h
	'dnl
</CODE></PRE>

<H2>The file needs expansion</H2>
Now to expand a macro within the file we must drop quotes, do
the expansion, and raise quotes once more.
This ends up looking like:<PRE><CODE>
	CDEFS= -D'HOSTTYPE`
</CODE></PRE>

The inverted quotes on HOSTTYPE allow the expansion of
just that word without any danger to the surrounding text.

<H2>Space, the final culture</H2>
The clever use of the m4 <I>ifelse</I> construct at the end of a
text line is the last trick we need to explore.
To make the expanded text look proper we format the ifelse like this:<PRE><CODE>
	${PROG}:$P ${OBJ}
		${CC} -o $@ ${CFLAGS} ${OBJ}'ifelse(
	HOSTTYPE,`SUN5',` -lgen',
	HOSTTYPE,`IRIX5',` -lgen')`
</CODE></PRE>

<P>
Note that take advantage of the m4 ifelse() function to
eat the embedded newlines.
This makes the comparison stick out at the beginning of each line.
