<H1>What we've arrived at</H1>
<P>
The new source organization depends on a three pronged attack:
<UL>
<LI>RCS to cache all the revisions to an single file
<LI>rcsvg to extract stable versions of each product from its own
source cache under /usr/msrc/<I>dept</I>
<LI>packages to group related products and documents into releases
</UL>

<P>
In addition the build environment is reused from the older master source
system to provide:
<UL>
<LI>platform indemendent builds
<LI>multiple developers working in parallel
<LI>a single source cache for any given product
<LI>source reuse and sharing among departments
</UL>
