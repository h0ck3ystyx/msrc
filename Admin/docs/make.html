<H1>The List</H1>
<P>
Uniformity in usage of a tool is called <EM>culture</EM>.
The UNIX make(1) utility supports a wide range of features
on the various *IX flavors -- some of which we may use
others we avoid because they would bind us to an "advanced"
version of make we would have to install and support on every
target platform.
<P>
In the case of make(1) we also have some predefined recipes
for constructing targets from prerequisite files.
These have canonically named macros (e.g. ${CC} ${CFLAGS})
which we must enhance to meet our goals.
<P>
Lastly the targets listed in each make(1) description should
be common in spelling and usage:
<UL>
<LI>all
Build the product, but do not install it.

<LI> clean
Remove all the temporary files used to build the product, but
not the source.

<LI> de-install
Remove the installed product and documentation.

<LI> depend
Update the transitive dependencies in this Makefile, don't use -a

<LI> dirs
Build the destination directories for the product.

<LI> distrib
Assuming the product is installed, copy it to the machine's peers
with distrib.

<LI> install
Install the product using install(1l).

<LI> lint
Reports any questionable C constructs.

<LI> mkcat
Use mkcat(8l) to install the documentation for the product.

<LI> print
Output the source code to the product to a printer.

<LI> source
Checkout all the source files needed to build the product.

<LI> spotless
Use rcsclean(1l) to remove un-modified products.

<LI> tags
Use ctags(1) to build a database of functions in the product.

<LI> ${SOURCE}:
Use to checkout source files on demand from RCS (or SCCS).

</UL>
<P>
Note:  Some of these targets do not make sense for the nature of the
product, i.e. it does not make sense to lint a shell script.
