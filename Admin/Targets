# $Id: Targets,v 2.1 1997/02/21 21:48:46 ksb Gamma $

This is the list of the targets supported by the meta source system.
You can add more as you need them. -- ksb

[quit:]

	If the default (all) target is too much to take without meaning
	it this "safety" catch is installed in the Makefile.

all: ${PROG}

	Build the product, but do not install it.

<user-targets>
	
	Used internally to build the product.

clean: FRC

	Remove all the temporary files used to build the product, but
	not the source.

deinstall: ${MAN} FRC
	
	Remove the installed product, and documentation.

depend: ${HDR} ${SRC} FRC

	Update the transitive dependencies in this Makefile, don't use -a

dirs: ${BIN} ${LIB}

	Build the destination directories for the product.

distrib: FRC

	Assuming the product is installed copy it to same CPUs with distrib

install: all dirs FRC

	Install the product.

lint: ${HDR} ${SRC} FRC

	Report questionable C constructs, if no C source do nothing.

mkcat: ${MAN} ${DOC}

	Install the documentation for the product.

print: source FRC

	Output the source code to the product to a printer.

[msource: ${SOURCE}]

	Create the master source, check it out from RCS.

[rsource: source]
	
	Create the remote (platform) source directories on the platforms
	given in $HOSTS.  These should be built under $INTO.

source: ${SOURCE}

	Checkout all the source files needed to build the product.

spotless: clean

	Use rcsclean to remove un-modified products.

[stage: dirs]

	Used only in the level 3 makefile to stage the release

tags: ${HDR} ${SRC}

	Use ctags to build a database of functions in the product.

/ ${BIN} ${LIB}:

	Used internally to build destination directories.

${SOURCE}:
	Used internally to RCS co source files.

FRC:
	Used internally to `force' targets.  Clean should really remove
	any file named FRC but we found that distasteful.
